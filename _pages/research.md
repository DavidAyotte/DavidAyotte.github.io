Currently, my Ph. D. research is about computational aspects of Drinfeld modular forms. A *Drinfeld modular forms* is a rigid analytic function defined over the Drinfeld upper half plane $$f:\Omega \rightarrow C$$ such that

$$
f\left( \frac{az+b}{cz+d} \right) = (\mathrm{det}\gamma)^{-m}(cz+d)^k f(z)
$$
