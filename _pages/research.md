I love mathematics with a hint of computer experiments. In this page, I explain briefly some projects I worked on in the past.

### Mathematics

Currently, my Ph. D. research is on the arithmetic aspects of Drinfeld modules and Drinfeld modular forms. These objects are analogues of elliptic curves and classical modular forms respectively but for global field of finite characteristic. I'm currently developing a SageMath package named [drinfeld_modules](https://github.com/DavidAyotte/drinfeld_modules) allowing computations with these objects.

In the past, for my [master thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11794/37368), I studied modular forms and their links with mysterious algebraic objects, such as the class number of a number field. In particular, I generalized a result about dihedral congruences for the coefficients of modular forms and did some computations with PARI/gp to verify my results (see the [scripts](https://github.com/DavidAyotte/sym2-dihedral)).

### Programming

During the summer 2021, I participated in the program [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) where I worked for an open source organization called [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). SageMath is a mathematical software built on top of multiple already existing open-source computing software (such as NumPy, SciPi, matplotlib, etc). The goal of my project was to implement the graded ring of quasimodular forms into the software. I blogged about my experience here on my website (see the section [GSoC](/gsoc-blog/)).

Since then, I continued to contribute to SageMath on a voluntary basis. My contributions includes new enhancements, bug fixes and code reviews. A list of my contributions can be found [here](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&author=~David+Ayotte&or&reviewer=~David+Ayotte&max=150&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority).
