Currently, my Ph. D. research is about computational aspects of Drinfeld modular forms. A *Drinfeld modular forms* is a rigid analytic function defined over the Drinfeld upper half plane $$f:\Omega \rightarrow C$$ such that

$$
f\left( \frac{az+b}{cz+d} \right) = (\mathrm{det}\gamma)^{-m}(cz+d)^k f(z)
$$

where $$a,b,c,d\in A = \mathbb{F}_q[T], ~ ad-bc \neq 0$$, $$k$$ and $$m$$ are two integers. There is also a holomorphic condition at infinity similar to the classical case, that is $$f$$ must satisfy an expansion of the form

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n\geq 0} c_n t(z)^n,
$$
where $$t(z)$$ is some function playing the role of parameter at infinity.

Computationnally speaking,
