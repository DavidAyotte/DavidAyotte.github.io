Hello!

I'm a PhD in Mathematics and I earned my degree in 2023 at Concordia University (Montréal, Canada) under the supervision of [Giovanni Rosso](https://sites.google.com/site/gvnros/). My thesis was about number theory, more precisely I studied the arithmetic and computational aspects of Drinfeld modular forms.

Previously, I obtained my BSc and MSc at Université Laval (Québec, Canada) under the supervision of [Antonio Lei](http://antoniolei.com/).

Now, I work in the finance industry as a data scientist.

I'm also an open source software developer for the project [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). You can learn a bit more about my contributions [here](/my-research/).
