I live in the province of Qu√©bec, Canada and I come from the beautiful region of [Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguenay%E2%80%93Lac-Saint-Jean). My native language is French.

In addition to mathematics and programming, I am passionate about endurance sports like swimming, cycling and running. I have participated in multiple [triathlons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon) (Sprint and Olympic distances). See some of my results [here](https://www.sportstats.ca/search-results.xhtml?query=David%20Ayotte%20Roberval&companies=[1]).
