In the previous post, I discussed about some changes made in the code for the graded ring of modular forms in SageMath. However, there was one lacking feature and it was the *pushout* of two modular forms space. I will explain this feature in this post.

Recall that our goal here was to give the class `ModularFormsRing` a *ring structure*. In other words, we want to be able to *add*, *substract* and *multiply* two given modular forms. This was implemented in SageMath by creating a new element class called `GradedModularFormElement`:

{% highlight text %}
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(1)
sage: E4 = M.0 # GradedModularFormElement
sage: E6 = M.1 # GradedModularFormElement
sage: E4 + E6
2 - 264*q - 14472*q^2 - 116256*q^3 - 515208*q^4 - 1545264*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: (E4 + E6).parent()
Ring of modular forms for Modular Group SL(2,Z) with coefficients in Rational Field
sage: E4 - E6
744*q + 18792*q^2 + 129696*q^3 + 550248*q^4 + 1605744*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: E4 * E6
1 - 264*q - 135432*q^2 - 5196576*q^3 - 69341448*q^4 - 515625264*q^5 + O(q^6)
{% endhighlight %}

To make the above example consistent with the actual implementation of modular forms in SageMath, we needed to implement the *pushout* of two modular forms spaces. In SageMath, the pushout of two parents $$P_1$$ and $$P_2$$ is a third parent $$Q$$ such that $$P_1 \hookrightarrow Q$$ and $$P_2 \hookrightarrow Q$$. In our case, let's take for example the following parents:

$$
P_1 := \mathcal{M}_4(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})) = \mathbb{C}E_4;
$$

$$
P_2 := \mathcal{M}_6(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})) = \mathbb{C}E_6;
$$


$$
Q:= \mathcal{M}_*(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})) = \bigoplus_{k\in \mathbb{Z}} \mathcal{M}_k(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})).
$$

We observe that $$P_1$$ and $$P_2$$ can both be embbeded into the ring $$Q$$. So, it would be desirable to have that the sum of an element of $$P_1$$ with an element of $$P_2$$ would return and element of $$Q$$. In SageMath, $$P_1$$ and $$P_2$$ are two instances of the class `ModularFormsSpace`. Hence, to make the pushout feature works, we simply added the following method:

{% highlight python %}
    def _pushout_(self, other):
        r"""
        Implement the pushout of ``self`` and ``other``.

        INPUT:

        - ``other`` -- ``ModularFormSpace`` or a ``ModularFormRing``

        OUTPUT: If ``self`` and ``other`` have the same groups and base rings, then this method returns
        ``self`` if the weights of the two spaces are equal, otherwise it returns a ``ModularFormsRing``.
        """
        from .find_generators import ModularFormsRing
        if isinstance(other, ModularFormsSpace):
            if self.group() == other.group() and self.base_ring() == other.base_ring():
                if self.weight() == other.weight():
                    return self
                else:
                    return ModularFormsRing(self.group(), base_ring=self.base_ring())
        if isinstance(other, ModularFormsRing) and other.has_coerce_map_from(self):
            return other
{% endhighlight %}

Thus, the code above makes the following example works:

{% highlight text %}

sage: e4 = ModularForms(1,4).0; e6 = ModularForms(1,6).0;
sage: e4.parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 1 for Modular Group SL(2,Z) of weight 4 over Rational Field
sage: e4 + e6
2 - 264*q - 14472*q^2 - 116256*q^3 - 515208*q^4 - 1545264*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: (e4 + e6).parent()
Ring of modular forms for Modular Group SL(2,Z) with coefficients in Rational Field

{% endhighlight %}

Thanks for reading!
