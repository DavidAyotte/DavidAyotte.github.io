I will explain in this post a brief summary of what is the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (abreviated GSoC). In short, the GSoC 2021 program is a 10-weeks program by Google where students all around the world are paired with mentors and work as developpers for open source organization.

The organization that I will be working for this summer is [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) together with the mentor [Vincent Delecroix](https://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/). SageMath is a mathematical software that can perform multiple computing task and is very useful for a wide variety of students and researchers. I personally used a lot this software in the past during my study, so I am very enthusiastic of being a part of this for the summer.

In particular, I will be implementing a new feature into this software, which is called the "ring of quasimodular forms". A more precise description of my project can be found [here](/files/GSoC_project.pdf).

I will be documenting my journey here in this blog where I will do every week a brief summary of my work.
