In this post I will briefly explain what is a partition of a positive integer and how it is possible to relate this theory to quasimodular forms via the Bloch-Okounkov theorem.

## Partitions

In mathematics, a *partition of a number $$n$$* is simply a finite sequence of integers $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_m$$ such that $$\lambda_i \geq \lambda_{i+1}$$ and

$$
n = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \cdots + \lambda_m,\quad m\geq 1.
$$

Equivalently, a *partition* is a sequence of integers $$\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_i, \ldots)$$ such that $$\lambda_i \geq \lambda_{i+1}$$ and $$\lambda_i = 0$$ for all but finitely many indices $$i$$. We denote by $$\vert \lambda \vert$$ the sum of its entries: $$ \vert \lambda \vert = \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_m$$.

For example, $$ (5,3,2) $$ is a partition of the number $$10$$ and $$(3,1,1)$$ is a partition of the number $$5$$.

**Exercise.** Find all the seven partitions of the number $$5$$.

We will denotes by $$\mathcal{P}$$ the set of all partitions. For our purpose, we will be working with function $$f : \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$$. An example of such function is $$f(\lambda) = \vert \lambda \vert$$. Given a function $$f$$ defined over $$\mathcal{P}$$, it is possible to construct a $$q$$-power series via the $$q$$-bracket:

$$
\langle f \rangle_q := \frac{\sum_{\lambda \in \mathcal{P}} f(\lambda) q^{\vert \lambda \vert}}{\sum_{\lambda \in \mathcal{P}}q^{\vert \lambda \vert}} \in \mathbb{Q}[[q]].
$$

The theorem of Bloch and Okounkov asserts that this $$q$$-bracket correspond to the $$q$$-expansion of a quasimodular form for a certain class of functions $$f:\mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$$ (called *shifted symmetric polynomials*). To defines these shifted symmetric polynomials, we will need the notion of Young diagram and the Frobenius coordinates of a partition.

## Young Diagrams and Frobenius Coordinates

One way of representing a partition visually is by the use of *Young diagrams*. The *Young diagram of a partition $$\lambda = (\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m)$$* is given by a series of squares:

![Young diagram of (5, 3, 1)](/images/posts/young_diagram.jpg){: width="250"}

In the example above, the top row of squares correspond to $$\lambda_1 = 5$$, the second row correspond $$\lambda_2 = 3$$ and so on.

**Exercise.** Draw the Young diagram of $$(5,4,3,3,2,1)$$.

Now, using the Young diagram of a partition, it is now possible to define the Frobenius coordinates of a partition. Let $$\lambda$$ be a partition. The *Frobenius coordinates of $$\lambda$$* is the numbers

$$
(r; a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r; b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_r)
$$

such that

* $$r$$ is the length of the longest principal diagonal in the Young diagram of $$\lambda$$;
* $$a_1 > \ldots > a_i >\ldots > a_r \geq 0$$ are the number of cells to the right of the $$i$$-th cell of this diagonal;
* $$b_1 > \ldots > b_i> \ldots > b_r \geq 0$$ are the number of cells below the $$i$$-th cell of this diagonal.

There is nothing better than an example to illustrate this definition. Consider the partition $$\lambda = (5, 3, 1)$$ with Young diagram:

![Young diagram of (5, 3, 1)](/images/posts/young_diagram.jpg){: width="250"}

By drawing the longest principal diagonal and counting the number of cells we get:

![frobenius coordinates](/images/posts/Inkedyoung_diagram_frob_coord_LI.jpg){: width="250"}

Thus, the Frobenius coordinates of $$\lambda = (5, 3, 1)$$ is

$$
(2; 4, 1; 2; 0)
$$

**Exercise.** Find the Frobenius coordinates of $$\lambda = (5,5,4,1)$$.

## Shifted Symmetric Polynomials

In this section, I will give a brief overview of the shifted symmetric polynomials. First, we need to define two invariants of a partition: $$P_k(\lambda)$$ and $$Q_k(\lambda)$$ for an integer $$k\geq 0$$.

**Definition.** Let $$\lambda$$ be a partition with Frobenius coordinates $$(r; a_1, \ldots, a_r; b_1,\ldots, b_r)$$ we define

$$
P_k(\lambda) := \sum_{i = 1}^r \left[ (a_i + 1/2)^k - (-b_i - 1/2)^k \right], \quad k\geq 0;
$$

$$
Q_k(\lambda) := \frac{P_{k-1}(\lambda)}{(k-1)!} + \beta_k,\quad k\geq 1;
$$

where $$\beta_k$$ is the $$k$$-th coefficients of the expansion of $$\frac{z/2}{\mathrm{sinh(z/2)}}$$ around $$z=0$$.

**Definition.** A *shifted symmetric polynomial* is a function $$f:\mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$$ living in $$\mathcal{R} := \mathbb{Q}[Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_k, \ldots]$$. We define $$\mathcal{R}_k \subset \mathcal{R}$$ to be the weight $$k$$ graded component of $$\mathcal{R}$$, that is the subring generated by the weight $$k$$ homogenenous monomials:

$$
\mathcal{R}_k = \langle Q_{k_1}^{m_1}\cdots Q_{k_N}^{m_N} : k_i, m_i\geq 1, k_1 m_1 + \cdots + k_N m_N = k \rangle
$$

**Theorem** (Bloch-Okounkov). For any $$f\in \mathcal{R}_k$$, the $$q$$-bracket $$\langle f \rangle_q$$ correspond to the $$q$$-expansion of a quasimodular forms of weight $$k$$ for $$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$$.

This theorem is interesting as it relates two apparently different concept: partitions and (quasi)modular forms. In particular, the Bloch-Okounkov theorem can be seen as a tool for studying partitions via quasimodular forms and vice versa.

A proof of this theorem can be found in the the main reference for this post:

[Don Zagier, Partitions, quasimodular forms and the Bloch-Okounkov theorem](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/files/doi/10.1007/s11139-015-9730-8/bloch-okounkov.pdf)

In the next weeks, I will be working on the SageMath implementation of the objects described above. In a later version of Sage, it should be possible to do computations with quasimodular forms and to compute the $$q$$-bracket of a shifted symmetric polynomial.

Thanks for reading!
